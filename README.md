Homework "Understanding Agile, Understanding Testing, and Project Management Tool Setup and First Stories"

I would like to first off mention thay I had some difficulties with either my spec_helper or poltergeist not responding to where exactly I wanted my test to visit.  I was unable to get all my test to pass at once but was able get them to pass while excluding one from the group each time.  I had trouble running them individually as I think there was an issue in my spec_helper.

Other than that I found the assignment easy  to approach with each step buidling on the last and testing more of your knowledge.
